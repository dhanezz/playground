## 🤔Why does this repository exist?

This is my personal learning space where I test and explore new technologies. The code may be incomplete, experimental, or just for fun. It is **public to keep myself accountable** for writing clean code and maintaining proper documentation. By sharing my progress, I aim to improve my coding practices and encourage continuous learning.

Basically a **debugging zone for my brain** - expect experiments, messy ideas, and hopefully some cool projects in the future! 🚀
